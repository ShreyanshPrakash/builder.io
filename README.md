Task at hand :

1. Create a ReactJS app that can use builder.io.
2. Connect with builder.io and create one page : (here : localhost:3000/about)
3. Create a backend such that UI can connect with the mongoDB instance.

How to Use :

1. npm install : install all the dependencies.
2. npm run start : starts the ui server @localhost:3000.
3. npm run server : starts the backend server @localhost:4200.


Working :

1.To leverage builder.io, i have created a page and published it. 
Take a look at localhost:3000/about.
As per the setup, the app will load the created page locally as well.

2. To see the working of mongoDB connection, go to localhost:4200/getData.
As per the requirement, i have created just a connection and not any collection or document
to be loaded in the UI.
